# EEC289Q - Modern Parallel Computing

Professor: John Owens

UC Davis - Winter 2018

Exploration of the architecture of modern parallel computers, their programming models, and their programming systems. This course focuses on modern parallel computing and for this particular offering of the course, GPU computing. We will explore using the programmable GPU as a parallel computer, primarily using the CUDA programming language (an extension to C/C++). We will cover the architecture of the GPU and its programming model; the CUDA programming language; fundamental data structures and algorithms on the GPU; numerous application domains and how they can be expressed on the GPU; programming models and high-level languages for GPU computing; and current research challenges in GPU computing. We expect that students who successfully complete this course will be ready to use GPU computing in their own projects and research, and/or be ready to conduct GPU-computing research on their own.
